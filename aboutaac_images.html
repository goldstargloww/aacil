<p>AAC is often used by people who can't speak out loud (verbally) in what are regarded as "words".</p>
<p>AAC comes in many forms.</p>
<p>It can be pointing to pictures in a book, or to letters on a board.   <img src="/AAC/crp.png"

alt="Drawing of two people, a yellow person holding a letterboard, and a teal person pointing at letters on the board. They are depicted with circular heads, triangle bodies, and floating circular hands."></p>
<p>It can be typing.   <img src="/AAC/tts user petri.png"

<p>It can be higher-tech, too, with specialized apps.   <img src="/AAC/aac tablet neon.png"
