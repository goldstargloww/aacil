The chao is a round little bipedal creature with a pastel blue body with tiny pink wings, and a teardrop shaped head with a small ball floating above the point on their head.

They are shown communicating through a speech bubble, inside of which is a red “X” and the same chao inside a tiny red and yellow car." src="/assets/symbols/i can't drive chao.png" width="300">
