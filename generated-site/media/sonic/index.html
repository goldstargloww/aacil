      <img alt="A drawing of the head of Amy Rose, from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, adoringly looking up at something, blushing slightly. Her hands (drawn floating) are clasped together and pressed against her face. She smiles with her mouth slightly open, and her eyelids droop slightly. Two red hearts float in front of her, and her eyes have small heart-shaped shines in them. Amy Rose, sporting her “classic” design, is an anthropomorphic hedgehog with pink quills and peach-tan fur around her muzzle and on her inner ears. Her silhouette makes her appear to have three distinct spines coming off of the back of her head, which are held back by a red headband. Her eyes resemble those of classic cartoon characters, lacking distinct irises, and are very large, with the scleras conjoined at the center of her face. She has a small tuft of fluffy bangs on the center of her forehead, and she wears white gloves on her hands." src="/assets/symbols/adoration classic amy rose.png" width="300">

      <img alt=": A drawing of Sonic the Hedgehog’s head, in lieu of an emoji, with an angry expression. His spines stick up and out dramatically and are extra pointy, and his ears stick up a bit more than usual as well. His brow is lowered angrily, and his mouth is a frown. His cheeks are puffed slightly and there’s a small amount of blush on them. Sonic the Hedgehog, seen here in his “classic” design, is an anthropomorphic hedgehog with blue quills all over his body except for the tan fur on his muzzle and inner ears. His eyes, whose pupils’s are all-black ellipses with white shines, are very big, and their scleras conjoin in the middle. His quills are stylized so that his silhouette has three distinct big spines growing out from the back of his head" src="/assets/symbols/angry classic sonic.png" width="300">

      <img alt="A drawing of Sonic the Hedgehog’s head, crying sadly. His ears are wilted, and his eyes are downturned, shedding a single tear. His mouth is not visible. Sonic is a cartoony, blue, anthropomorphic hedgehog with a tan muzzle and inner ears, and big eyes with scleras that conjoin in the middle of his face. He’s portrayed with his “classic” design, with a rounder silhouette that appears to have three big spines protruding out of the back of his head, as well as a bean-shaped nose, and lighter blue quills. His eyes lack irises, and instead have pupils that are black ovals with white shines, reminiscent of classic black-and-white cartoon characters." src="/assets/symbols/crying sad classic sonic.png" width="300">

The chao is a round little bipedal creature with a pastel blue body with tiny pink wings, and a teardrop shaped head with a small ball floating above the point on their head. The ends of their limbs and top of their head are yellow. This chao’s emotion ball has turned into an exclamation mark. They are shown communicating through a speech bubble, inside of which is a red “X” and the same chao inside a tiny red and yellow car." src="/assets/symbols/i can't drive chao.png" width="300">

Maria, who is smiling, is a pale-skinned human girl with medium-length warm blonde hair and purplish-blue eyes. Here, she is portrayed with a large nose, glasses with circular frames, and a poofier hair texture. Most of Maria’s hair is tucked behind her with a purplish-blue headband, and the hair in front of the headband is parted in the middle and cut a bit shorter than the rest, framing her face." src="/assets/symbols/maria robotnik.png" width="300">

      <img alt="A drawing of Sonic the Hedgehog’s head, in lieu of an emoji, with a sad, dejected expression: His head is downturned, his eyelids are drooped and his brows are lowered, his mouth is a small frown, and his ears are flopped over sadly instead of being upright like usual. Sonic the Hedgehog is an anthropomorphic hedgehog with blue quills on most of his body and tan fur on his muzzle and inner ears. He has big eyes that are conjoined by the sclera in the center. His quills are stylized into long arcs with pointed ends, so his silhouette appears to have three distinct spines growing out of the back of his head. Sonic is seen with his “Classic” design, sporting lighter blue quills, shorter spines and an overall more rounded appearance, and eyes with no irises, simply being black ellipses with white shines." src="/assets/symbols/sad classic sonic.png" width="300">

While curled into a ball, Sonic rapidly spins in place like a tire, simply appearing as an angled blue oval with clouds of smoke trailing behind him. Above this are dark grey icons of standard video game controller buttons showing how to preform a Spin Dash in the games. There is a downward arrow, then a plus sign to show that both buttons must be pressed simultaneously, and a circular face button labeled “A”. The letter A is faint to allude to how, in most cases, any face button will work for this, not just “A”." src="/assets/symbols/spin dash alt.png" width="300">
