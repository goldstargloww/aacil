      <img alt=": A drawing of a grey oval with a simplified yellow human standing inside, frowning and with jagged lines coming off of them to indicate pain. 10 triangular shapes or “slices” come out from this center oval, each labeled with numbers 1 through 10 to represent different pain levels. Each is a different color, with 1 being a bluish green, and the colors shifting as the numbers get higher through green, yellow, orange, and red, with 10 being dark red. Each slice also has a pair of cartoony eyes with eyebrows drawn on its thick end to show the expression someone might have at each respective pain level. The expressions start happy at 1, and gradually get more visibly distressed as the numbers get higher, with 10 having the eyes squeezed shut and crying profusely." src="/assets/symbols/pain scale plum.png" width="300">
