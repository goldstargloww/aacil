 <p><b>Simpler words:</b> The pictures on this website are for people to use to communicate.  This is because it is important that people can communicate about anything they want to.</p>
 <p>Pictures on this website might say things that not everyone agrees with.</p>
 <p>Pictures on this website might say things the person making the website does not agree with.  This is okay, because this website is for everyone who uses AAC to talk about everything.  AAC users have a right to talk about everything in their own lives.</p>
 <p>There might also be pictures of things that other people make money from.  That's okay, because the pictures here don't make money, and we checked to make sure we weren't doing anything wrong by putting the pictures here.</p>
 <p>If you make money from something you think we have a symbol of, and you don't want the symbol here, please email aacschar@gmail.com and tell us.</p><br>
<p><b>More complex words:</b> Any views expressed by any symbols in this Library do not neccessarily respresent the opinions of the project or the website runner. We believe it is of vital importance that AAC users have their right to freedom of expression met and are not censored in how they communicate in their everyday life.

If you believe AACIL is in violation of your copyright, and for some reason are of the opinion a pensioner's not-for-profit disability access project enabling people to ask for and discuss your product is depriving you of revenue, please contact us by email at aacschar@gmail.com.</p>
