    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<b>Who can use AACIL symbols?</b>
<p>If you're an AAC user, you can use AACIL symbols in your AAC. If you help AAC users with their AAC, you can use AACIL symbols too.  There's a more detailed answer <a href="https://aacil.neocities.org/copyright">on this page</a>.</p>

<b>How can I contact AACIL?</b>
<p>You can email <u>aacschar@gmail.com</u>.</p>

<b>Why do you have a symbol of something I don't like?</b>
<p>To tell us you don't like it, you need to be able to refer to it. For many symbol AAC users, that means needing a symbol of it. Also, communication is a right, and that means everybody has a right to say what they want to in their personal life, even if we don't agree with it.  AACIL making symbols of something available does not mean AACIL endorses what is being depicted.</p>

<b>I don't like one of your artists.  Will you remove their symbols from AACIL?</b>
<p>AACIL isn't making you use any of its symbols. AACIL gives you the option to use them if you want to.  If you want to use some symbols, or don't want to use some symbols, that's your choice to make.  We're not going to take that choice away from other people.  AACIL making symbols by an artist available does not mean AACIL endorses the artist. Human rights can't be made conditional on anyone's own behaviour, let alone somebody else's! Somebody's actions mustn't limit their own, let alone anybody else's, right to communication.
