Little symbols that look like starbursts or popping bubbles are around their head as well. Close to their open, non-spiral eye is a series of progressively smaller waves that eventually turn into a single long wavy line as it goes farther away from them. there's a version of them slightly less visible behind them and a purple arrow pointing right on its right side showing that it's before">

alt="A drawing of a circular diagram showcasing the “cycle” of psychiatry. A simple yellow person has their cartoony brain visible, which has a red scribble inside. An arrow goes from them, through a speech bubble containing the same red scribble, and to another simple yellow person glowing red, dressed in a white undershirt and light blue button-up. An arrow goes from them, through a bottle of prescription pills and a paper prescription, and back to the first person. ">
